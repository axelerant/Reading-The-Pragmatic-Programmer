# Pragmatic Paranoia

> You can't write perfect software.

- Accept, Embrace, and celebrate the above fact because perfect software doesn't exist.
- Unless you accept this as a fact, you'll end up wasting time and energy chasing an impossible dream.
- Given this fact, how does a pragmatic programmer turn it into an advantage? This is what we will discus in this chapter.

> _*Everyone knows that they personally are the only good driver on Earth*_

- The rest of the world is out there to get them and generally not living up to our standards. So we drive defensively.
- The analogy with coding is pretty obvious. A lot of times we work on other people's code - code that might not live up to our high standards. Hence, we are taught to code defensively.
- We use assertions to detect bad data & distruct data from potential attackers or trolls.
- We check for consistency, put constraints on database columns, and generally feel pretty good about ourselves.

> _*But Pragmatic programmers take this a step further*_

^^ How??

> Pragmatic Programmers don't trust themselves, either.

> Knowing that fact that no one writes perfect software, including themselves, Pragmatic Programmers build in defenses against their own mistakes.
