## Foreword

- The second edition came after 20 years after the first one, which was a classic.
- It's a technical book but without the jargon or convoluted examples.
- It's for "programmers who just want to be better."
- The new edition removes some of the older references and replaces them with modern content. The lessons are still there but the examples are now relatable to the current trends.
- They got feedback on the content from the first edition and formulated new ideas, new concepts.
- Importance of agency: developers have arguably more agency than most other professionals.
- The book starts with the message: "it's your life".
- What makes it truly stand out is that it understands what it means to be a programmer.
