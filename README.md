## Foreword

- The second edition came after 20 years after the first one, which was a classic.
- It's a technical book but without the jargon or convoluted examples.
- It's for "programmers who just want to be better."
- The new edition removes some of the older references and replaces them with modern content. The lessons are still there but the examples are now relatable to the current trends.
- They got feedback on the content from the first edition and formulated new ideas, new concepts.
- Importance of agency: developers have arguably more agency than most other professionals.
- The book starts with the message: "it's your life".
- What makes it truly stand out is that it understands what it means to be a programmer.

## Preface

- The book started as notes the authors jotted down for their clients. It seemed to strike a chord and got popular.
- 20 years is a lifetime in terms of software. The book's (first edition) references were quaint and confusing.
- But 20 years has no impact on common sense. Technology changes but people don't. What aspects were a good idea then remained a good idea now.
- For second edition, authors updated the technologies they referenced and reexamined the assumptions behind the practices.
- One-third of the book is brand new and the majority of the rest was rewritten.
- The authors dropped things that didn't make a lot of sense anymore and focused on new challenges and paradigms such as concurrency.
