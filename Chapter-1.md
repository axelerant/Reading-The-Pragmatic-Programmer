# A Pragmatic Philosophy

 - It is your career, your life. You own it.
 - It is an atitude, style, a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions.
 - The Cat Ate My Source Code - Take responsibility.
 - Software Entropy - Importance of not having the 1st broken window in your code.
 - Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs - Importance of big picture and need for change.
 - Good-Enough Software - When can we say a software is good enough with necessarry trade-offs.
 - Knowledge Portfolio - Keep learning and how to keep the momentum for the same.
 - Finally Communicate!

## It's Your Life

 - You own it. You run it. You create it.
 - Developers being frustrated with varying concerns about stagnating in job, work loction or being backward in technology front.
 - Why can't you change it?
 - You have more agency working in software development career.
 - Work for what you want, do not resist change and be proactive.

 ## The Cat Ate My Source Code

 - "The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak".
 - Do not be afraid to admit ignorance or error.
 - Take charge of your career advancement and learning.
 - Things go wrong inspite of thorough testing, documentation and automation.
 - Must own up to our shortcomings - our ignorance and our mistakes.

 ### Team Trust

 - Team Trust is important and everyone should be comfortable replying on others where needed.
 - Trust allows us to be open and honest, speak our mind and present our ideas.

 ### Take Responsibility

 - In addition to making ourselves accountable, analyze the situation for risks that are beyond control (there always will be).
 - Have contigency plan for the risks identified.
 - When a mistake is made, admit honestly.
 - Instead of excuses offer alternatives or options.
 - Don't blame anyone or anything.
 - There is nothing that can't be done. Find the way and costs associated with it.
 - "You have the right not to take responsibility for an impossible situation, or one in which the risks are too great, or the ethical implications too sketchy. Youâ€™ll have to make the call based on your own values and judgement"

 ### Challenges

 - How do you react when someone - such as a bank teller, an auto mechanic, or a clerk-comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their company as a result?
 - When you find yourself saying, "I don't know," be sure to follow it up with "-but I'll find out." It's a great way to admit what you don't know, but then take responsiblity like a pro.

 ## Software Entropy

 - Entropy - Amount of disorder in a system
 - Naturally, entropy is bound to increase.
 - Technical debt is just an optmistic term we use to give us an notion that we will work on it someday. We won't.
 - Project Pyschology being one major factor that contribute to technical debt (or) software rot
 - Projects with best plan and people experience ruin and projects with enormous difficulties and constant setbacks come out pretty well at end. Why?

 ### Broken Windows

 - Analogy of an building which starts to deteriorate  - it all starts with 1 broken window.
 - A broken window left unrepaired gives a false sense of abondonment until it becomes real.
 - Hopelessness can be contaigious in a community and in a team creating a vicious spiral.
 - Broken window in software - bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code
 - Neglect accelerates software rot faster than any other factor.
 - Take some action to prevent further damage.
 - Get a dumpster and trash what is not needed, fix what is needed.
 - Cause no additional harm.
 - One bad decision that the team needs to live with is all it takes for decline.
 - It's all about the mindset - when everything is good in the project, no one wants to be the first to make a mess. On contrary, when there is already a lot of broken windows, you know what happens.

### Challenges

 - What are the broken windows in your projects? What can be done to fix them?
 - Can you tell when a window first gets broken? If it is due to someone else decision, what can you do about it?
