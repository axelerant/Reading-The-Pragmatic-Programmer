 ### Team Trust

 - Team Trust is important and everyone should be comfortable replying on others where needed.
 - Trust allows us to be open and honest, speak our mind and present our ideas.

 ### Take Responsibility

 - In addition to making ourselves accountable, analyze the situation for risks that are beyond control (there always will be).
 - Have contigency plan for the risks identified.
 - When a mistake is made, admit honestly.
 - Instead of excuses offer alternatives or options.
 - Don't blame anyone or anything.
 - There is nothing that can't be done. Find the way and costs associated with it.

 #### Challenges

 - How do you react when someone - such as a bank teller, an auto mechanic, or a clerk-comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their company as a result?
 - When you find yourself saying, "I don't know," be sure to follow it up with "-but I'll find out." It's a great way to admit what you don't know, but then take responsiblity like a pro.
